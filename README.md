# CSE676_SP22_FINAL_PROJECT
This is the final project for CSE676 Deep Learning for the term spring 2022 from Prajit Krissna Kumar (50338193), Rahul Dhanapal (50418617), Shivendra Srinivas (50425044) and Akhil Goyal (50415687).

GAN generator and discriminator are in gan_utils.py

Procedure to run code:

1. Run defaulf_classification.py
2. Run final_gan_generation.py
3. Run aftergan_generation.py
4. Run Test_classification.py
5. If GAN results need to be visualized, run plotting.py or use tensorboard

The dataset and models generated by the codes above are stored in the given UB Box link:
